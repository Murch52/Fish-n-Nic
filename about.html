 About the Fising Trip:</h2>

<p>
 We start off at the doc at Indian Lake in Carrol County. On this picturesque lake you will be able to sit back, relax, and fish! I provide snacks, drinks, and the fishing supplies. After we fish for the ammount of time you chose ($75 per hour) we go back to the picnic area for dinner. There I will prepare dinner, which includes: hamburgers, hotdogs, chips, and drinks ($50). </p>

  About the Guide:</h2>

<p>
Jake Murchison: I was born and raised in Jackson, Tennessee. I grew up fishing and still love to fish every chance I get. I have just recently graduated high school at Trinity Christian Academy and was thinking about what I could do for a summer job. While fishing with my friend Heath Harris, he told me the only thing he hated about fishing was the work it took to set everything up. It was then I had a great idea, why don't I go to the lake, set evrything up, and take people fishing? I took some time and thought about this idea, I could go to Indian Lake, set everything (including lunch or dinner) up, and all the guests would have to do is cast, eat, and enjoy! I took what I had learned in my recent economics class and drew up a rather rough business plan for my great idea. I think that this would be a great, hassle-free experience for parents and their children to enjoy for summers to come, hope to see you soon!
