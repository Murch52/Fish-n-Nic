 About the Fising Trip:</h2>

<p>
 The expedition starts off at the doc at a private lake just outside of Madison County. On this picturesque lake you will be able to sit back, relax, and fish! I provide snacks, drinks, and the fishing supplies. After we fish, for the amount of time you chose ($75 per hour) we go back to the picnic area for lunch or dinner ($50). There I will prepare the meal, which includes: hamburgers, hotdogs, chips, drinks, and dessert.</p>

  About the Guide:</h2>

<p>
 Jake Murchison: </br> I was born and raised in Jackson, Tennessee. I grew up fishing and still love to fish every chance I get. I have just recently graduated high school at Trinity Christian Academy, and was thinking about what I could do for a summer job. While fishing with my friend, Heath Harris, he told me the only thing he hated about fishing was the work it took to set everything up. It was then I had a great idea... Why don't I go to the lake, set evrything up, and take people fishing? All the guests would have to do is cast, eat, and enjoy! I took what I had learned in my recent economics class and drew up a rather rough business plan. I think that this would be a great, hassle-free experience for parents and their children to enjoy for summers to come. Hope to see you soon!
